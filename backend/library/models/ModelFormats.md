## Model Formats Specification v2
Each model should have its own folder named after its model (The folder name is publicly visible).  
The folder should contain the following files in its root directory:

- `preprocess.py`
- `predict.py`
- `metadata.txt`

Note: The specific model's folder structure can deviate from this structure, but these files must be present in the root directory.

The requirements and guidelines for each file are as follows:

### preprocess.py
Each preprocess.py file must contain a function named `preprocess_image` that takes in an image path and returns a preprocessed image for the model.

#### Limitations
- The function **MUST** not change the image stored at the image path.
- The function is only expected to handle a single image at a time.  
- The function is expected to handle image inputs for all of the following image formats [.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif]
- The function is not expected to handle the case where the image path is invalid. 
    - The backend is expected to only pass valid image paths to the function.


##### Example preprocess.py file:
```python
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # Preprocess image
    return image
```

#### Notes
The preprocess file does not have to follow most of the guidelines for the predict file.
- An example is to have the function pass the `image_path` along if the model does not require preprocessing.  

The only hard requirements are as follows:
- The file must have a function is named `preprocess_image` that takes an `image_path` argument and returns an object.
- The file must not change the image stored at the image path.

### predict.py
Each predict.py file must contain a function named `predict` that takes in both a preprocessed image, its root folder path and returns a prediction for the model.

#### Limitations
- The function is only expected to handle a single image at a time.
- The function is expected to return a prediction for the image.

##### Example predict.py file:
```python
from keras.models import load_model

def predict(img, path):
    model = load_model(f"{path}\model.h5")
    return model.predict(img)
```

#### Notes
The `predict.py` function requirements are quite loose.  
The output format is also quite with two paths.
- [RECOMMENDED] [LOOSE] You supply an `label.txt` file with each label on a newline and a list of predctions.
    - This requires you to return a prediction with the format
    [[List of probabilities in label order]]
- [INTEGRATED] You handle labelling in `predict.py` 
    - The required format is a sorted list of predictions with the highest probability first.
    - Format: [probabilityString(20 d.p. or less), label]
    - Example: 
    ```
        [['0.99999999999999999999', 'cat'], ['0.00000000000000000001', 'dog']]
    ```

### metadata.txt
The metadata.txt file is a text file that contains information about the model so the backend can handle different models.

#### Limitations
- The properties are not case sensitive.
- The properties **ARE** case sensitive.

#### Fields (In Order)
- Model Format Specification Version
- Predict.py return type (integration or loose)
- Model Framework

##### Example metadata.txt file:
```txt
v2
integrated
tensorflow
```

#### Field Descriptions
- Model Format Specification Version\
The version of the model format specification that the model follows.
    - The current version is `v2`,
    - `v1` represents the lack of a specification and is non-functional.
- Predict.py return type\
  The type of return that the predict.py file returns.
    - `integrated` means that the predict.py file handles labelling and returns a formatted prediction.
    - `loose` means that the predict.py file returns a list of probabilities in label order.
        - This requires a `label.txt` file to be present in the model folder.
- Model Framework\
The framework that the model uses.
    - Current options: [`tensorflow` and `pytorch`]
    - This property is not currently used by the backend, but is included for future use.
